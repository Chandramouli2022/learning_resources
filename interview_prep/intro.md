Basic intro

Hi, I’m Chandra Mouli, a Full-Stack Developer and DevOps Engineer with a degree in ECE from NIT Surat. I love building scalable web apps and backend systems using tools like React, Node.js, and Kubernetes. Right now, I'm working at Tata Power, where I've been creating solutions that improve efficiency—like a QR-based app that cut project costs by 30%, and automation tools that save hours of manual work every month. I’ve also solved over 250 DSA problems because I enjoy solving them especially dynamic programming. I’m always looking to learn something new and build things that make a real impact.

Elaborated intro

Hi, I’m **Chandra Mouli**, a Full-Stack Developer and DevOps Engineer with a B.Tech in Electronics and Communication Engineering from NIT Surat. I’m passionate about building practical, high-impact tech solutions—from clean, intuitive front-ends to robust and scalable backends.

Currently, I’m working at **Tata Power**, where I’ve had the chance to design and deploy full-stack applications used by over 1,000 users weekly. One of the most impactful projects I’ve worked on there was a **QR code-based web app** that allows users to instantly fetch detailed information about field equipment. This tool helped reduce project capitalization time and cost by **30%**, and made on-ground operations significantly smoother. I developed the full stack for it—from building secure RESTful APIs using Node.js and PostgreSQL, to integrating QR scanning logic on the front end with React.js.

In parallel, I’ve also automated internal reporting workflows, saving teams hours every week by generating and emailing Excel reports using Node.js, Axios, and Nodemailer.

Apart from work, I’ve solved over **250 data structures and algorithms problems**, which really sharpened my approach to writing clean and optimized code. I also love building side projects that push me to learn—like an **interactive DSA Array Visualizer and Code Editor** that lets users write and visualize algorithms in real time using Python or JavaScript.

I’m always excited to collaborate, learn new technologies, and build things that make people’s lives easier.
