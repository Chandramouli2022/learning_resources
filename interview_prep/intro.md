Hi, I’m Chandra Mouli, a Full-Stack Developer and DevOps Engineer with a degree in ECE from NIT Surat. I love building scalable web apps and backend systems using tools like React, Node.js, and Kubernetes. Right now, I'm working at Tata Power, where I've been creating solutions that improve efficiency—like a QR-based app that cut project costs by 30%, and automation tools that save hours of manual work every month. I’ve also solved over 250 DSA problems because I enjoy solving them especially dynamic programming. I’m always looking to learn something new and build things that make a real impact.
